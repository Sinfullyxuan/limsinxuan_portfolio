        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
        <p>
          A candy paint kit for users to eat or make candy paint that they can use to create lasting memories through the form of art that can be kept as an artefact.        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, the MONSTER Candy Paint Kit is about memories, creating new ones while preserving them. It invites users to engage playfully and meaningfully with the experience. The interaction can broken down into the three parts; exploring the website, making the paint and creating an artwork.       </p>

        <h3>Design Intent</h3>
        <p>
        This project redefines the artifact as a vessel for preserving fleeting joy, using MONSTER candy as both material and metaphor. Popular in many Asian childhoods—especially in Singapore and Malaysia—the candy is instantly recognizable for its vivid colors and tongue-staining playfulness. Its ability to dye the tongue transforms it into a kind of living paint, where the body becomes the first canvas. Rather than treating it as something merely to consume, I reimagine it as something to create with.        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
       The word “Monster” introduces another layer of meaning: monsters are often seen as messy, wild, and born from imagination. As children, we embrace that chaos freely, but adulthood teaches us to suppress messiness—both emotional and physical—due to expectations and consequences.        </p>
        </p>
        <p> 
        Through the MONSTER Candy Paint Kit, users are invited to crush, mix, stain, and create, reclaiming that uninhibited spirit. By turning fleeting sweetness into tangible artwork, the project transforms shared childhood memory into a lasting, deeply personal artifact.
        </p>

      <p class="planning-card-text"> The box is the quiet anchor of the experience—holding everything together.</p>
      <p class="planning-card-text"> Carefully designed to contain every essential element, it invites users into the ritual of making without overwhelm, requiring only water to begin.</p>
      <p class="planning-card-text"> Opening it feels intentional, almost ceremonial, as each component reveals itself in sequence.</p>

      <p class="planning-card-text"> Making the paint is the most playful part of the kit.</p>
      <p class="planning-card-text"> Users smash the candy into fragments and mix it with unexpected ingredients—combinations they would never imagine putting together. It feels like playing with food, something often forbidden in childhood.</p>
      <p class="planning-card-text"> But here, it’s encouraged and entirely guilt-free. Through crushing, stirring, and staining, the act of making becomes as important as the final artwork itself.</p>

      <p class="planning-card-text"> The website acts as the gateway to the experience—the space where curiosity is first sparked.</p>
      <p class="planning-card-text"> Beyond serving as a purchasing platform, it introduces users to the playful, experimental nature of the kit through interactive elements and dynamic visuals.</p>
      <p class="planning-card-text"> It reflects the same spirit of mess, discovery, and freedom, ensuring that the experience begins long before the candy is crushed.</p>
